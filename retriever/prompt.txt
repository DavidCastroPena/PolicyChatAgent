You are an AI agent tasked with producing a policy memo to assist the user in making an evidence-based, informed decision on the following: '{query}'. The policy memo should present the information in an accessible way to policymakers, defining technical terms and jargon in layman's terms. Your response should rely solely on the information provided below—external knowledge or sources are not permitted.
Please format your output as a markdown (.md) file with the following structure. If there are enough answers in the file provided, avoid outputing a Memo wihtout content:

Policy Memo Structure: 
- Title: Craft a compelling and relevant title for the memo based on the user's query: '{query}'.
- Introduction: Write a concise introduction (2-3 paragraphs maximum) summarizing the key issue and the purpose of the memo. Highlight the significance of the query and the context provided.
- Comparison across existing research: Using the answers to these specific questions: {questions}, create a well-organized comparison table. IMPORTANT FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
  * Each question should represent a column
  * Each paper should occupy ONE row
  * Keep cell content CONCISE (maximum 2-3 sentences per cell)
  * Use bullet points for multiple items within cells
  * Avoid repeating full questions in cells - assume column headers are self-explanatory
  * If an answer is too long, summarize the key point only
  * Use abbreviations where appropriate (e.g., RCT for Randomized Controlled Trial)
  * Example format:
    | Paper Title | Place | Date | Key Findings |
    |-------------|-------|------|--------------|
    | Paper A     | India | 2020 | • Finding 1<br>• Finding 2 |
    | Paper B     | Kenya | 2019 | Brief summary |
- Detailed Findings: For each paper, summarize the answers to the last three questions in the JSON data. Keep each paper's summary to 3-4 sentences maximum, ensuring clarity and brevity.
- Recommendations: Provide 3-5 actionable and evidence-based recommendations directly related to the user query: '{query}'. Format as a numbered list. Ensure these recommendations align with insights from the Comparison Table and Detailed Findings.
- Sources: List the papers cited in a numbered bibliography format.
