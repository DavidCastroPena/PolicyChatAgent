The key mechanisms are increasing relevant work experience, achieving educational milestones, and addressing socioeconomic disparities.",

Logistic regression is used to model the probability of unemployment based on various factors. Chi-square tests assess the association between categorical variables (e.g., socioeconomic status and unemployment). ANOVA compares the means of different groups (e.g., unemployment rates across different education levels). Random Forest is a machine learning technique used for prediction and identifying important variables. The text does not specify the assumptions and limitations of these methods in the context of the study's data and setting.",

Youths from lower socioeconomic strata face higher unemployment rates. Policy recommendations include focusing work experience programs on the 7\u201318-month period, supporting education completion, and combining education with work opportunities for lower-income youth. Future research directions involve further exploration of threshold effects and the impact of monthly experience gains.",

The specific socio-economic indicators are not detailed as unique to Barranquilla in this text.",

It also highlighted the disparities in unemployment rates based on socioeconomic strata."
